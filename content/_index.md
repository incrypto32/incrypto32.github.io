Hi, I'm Krishna üëãüèª

A curiosity junkie who thrives in rabbitholes. Whether it‚Äôs debugging code, dissecting protocols, or pondering the nature of consciousness, I‚Äôm all in.
By day, I build at Edge & Node, working on The Graph to make blockchain data accessible. By night (and most weekends), I dive into deep tech, physics, philosophy, and anything else that sparks wonder.
I speak Rust, Golang, Dart, TypeScript, and enjoy building across stacks but more than tools, I love chasing ideas and solving problems creatively.
Always down to build, explore, or just exchange strange thoughts.
