# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post using Zola, a fast static site generator written in Rust.

## What is Zola?

Zola is a static site generator that:
- Is fast and reliable
- Has built-in syntax highlighting
- Supports themes
- Uses the Tera templating engine

## Getting Started

Creating content is as simple as writing markdown files like this one!

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Zola!");
}
```

Stay tuned for more posts!
