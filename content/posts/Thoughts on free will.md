I recently started learning more about quantum computing and somehow that drove me into an existential crisis. From quantum mechanics its easy to get distracted into existential questions and somehow i ended up on the topic of free will, consciousness etc from there, and my original goal of learning about quantum computing was left on hold. This is the typical me, start out on something and gets distracted into distantly related topic after a chain reaction of exploration only to fall into a rabbitholes, and i love rabbitholes.

So i always had the thought that universe could be deterministic everything in the universe follows the laws of physics and "most" of these laws have deterministic outcomes. Based on my understanding of physics everything is in fact deterministic. If we take newtons laws of motion for example, we can totally determine the position of a ball thrown at any point of time given all the factors. So in my view everything was indeed determinstic, since everything was made up of matter inlcuding humans and matter obeyed the laws of physics. So if everything including us - humans and all the animals, plants in this universe are just following the laws of physics, this means everything has a cause, there's nothing happening on its own. The ball we talked about early was in the air because i decided to throw it, and i decided to throw it for the sake of an example, and why did i need an example? Because i was writing about free will, why did i write about free will, because i read something that lead to it... So everything is cause-effect. So i always had this thought but i always did believe there is something else at play in our brains that can make some sort of free decisions. I didn't believe it when someone told me everything is fate, i didn't believe in the concept of fate. Only did i recently got the time to actually stumble on to the truth that its in fact very scientific, and a wide majority of scientists are in agreement that free will doesn't exist. These are neuroscientists who studies the brain and from what i have read so far decisions are made in the brain even before we are consciously aware of it, so its almost like brain is just a machine.

Are we all just biological robots?
