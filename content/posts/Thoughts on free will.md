I recently wrote something down about free will on my Boox device, and i started out grieving that i recently learned that chances are free will might not exist, scietifically.. alteast the scientific proofs suggest that and we dont have much proof to counter it. So being me, i was upset.. and thought if free will doesn't exist why do we live at all, it got me thinking then life becomes utterly meaningless, its not like it had an inherent meaning before this knowledge its just that, the world as it is today doesn't make much sense at all if free will doesn't exist.

Towards the end of my mind dump i had a conclusion and i shared some of the insights that i got with my friends, basically the conclusion that i arrived was that whether or not free will exists we don't know i explored a few scenaros, but it felt like that even if free will doesn't really exist.. it won't matter much, if science someday find definitive proof that free will doesn't exist, thinks might change in the short run, may cause momentary chaos but things will go back to normal very soon after.
